Braeden Deerinng

Finds:
    I found these findings by recording the results of the slider with a and or b off or on and changing the slider number
        Point 0-19 is the two swords 
        Point 20-39 is the deer
        Point 40-99 is the lion 
        Point 100 is the dragon 
        When using A and or B
        Both disable= Queen Osha, The Blessed 
        A enabled= Ser Jaclyn Sand, The Blessed
        B enabled= Lord Loras Waters, The Blessed
        both enabled= Queen Osha, The Blessed
            this last part can be seen as a set of two booleans and they show that only won of the true being truw will lead to a different name, but both of them being true will lead to the same name as if both of them were false.
